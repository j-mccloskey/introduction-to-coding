# Introduction to Coding

This repo contains the solutions for the exercises during the introduction to programming session with Python.
To learn more about Python a good starting point would be [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/learn/python)

## Exercise 1 - Variables
Create well named variables for each of the following:
* First name
* Surname
* University attended
* Age
* Maximum heart rate (220-Age)
Print each of the variables

[Solution](./solution_variables.py)

## Exercise 2 - Output and String manipulation
Print each variable you created in its own sentence

[Solution](./solution_output.py)

## Exercise 3 - User Input
Use user input to get values for each of your variables.
Prompt the user to enter a value for each one.
Continue to print each one in its own sentence

[Solution](./solution_input.py)

## Exercise 4 - Conditionals
Continue to build upon what you have done.
Prompt the user for y/n input whether they can drive or not

Print suitable messages for the following conditions:
* Can drive and are above legal age
* Can drive but are below the legal age
* Can’t drive and are below legal age
* Can’t drive but are above the legal age

[Solution](./solution_conditionals.py)

## Exercise 5 - Loops
Prompt the user for a sentence
Use a loop to remove any letters that are vowels
Print the new sentence

[Solution](./solution_loops.py)

## Exercise 6 - Functions
Create a functions to:
* Calculate max heart rate
* Remove vowels from a given string

Use each function multiple times and print result

[Solution](./solution_functions.py)

## Fizz Buzz Challenge
Define a function called **fizz_buzz** that has one integer parameter. It should:
* Return **Fizz** when the integer is a multiple of **3**
* Return **Buzz** when the integer is a multiple of **5**
* Return **FizzBuzz** when integer is a multiple of **both 3 and 5**
* Return the integer without any modification in all other cases

Write a function called **challenge** that will call the **fizz_buzz** function for all integers from 1 to 100 and print the result of each time

[Solution](./fizz_buzz_challenge.py)

[Tests](./fizz_buzz_challenge_test.py)

## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
* Write a program to play ’Rock, Paper, Scissors’ against the computer. It should
* Print a welcome message
* Make a random choice for the computer
* Ask the user for their choice, repeat until it’s a valid one
* Print the result  (Win/Lose/Draw)

[Solution](./RPS_basic.py)

## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game - Extra features
Ask the player if they want to play again.
Print the score at the end of the game session (W/D/L record)

[Solution](./RPS_with_scores.py)


## Lists of Lists
* Write a program that displays the vending machine to a user
* Prompt them for the co-ordinates of their selection
* Print the name of the item they pick

[Solution](./solution_lists.py)

## Dictionaries
* Write a program where users can input the name of a movie
* Output the names of the main actors for that movie
* Handle scenario where movie is not known
